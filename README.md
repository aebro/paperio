# Paper.IO

> This is a clone of the original Paper-IO released by Voodoo, except for one aspect. This will attempt to implement a multi-player aspect of the game (like a real IO game). Currently this has a playground at this [link](https://thekidofarcrania.github.io/BlocklyIO). It's a demo version of what to come. Hopefully by that time, the necessary server infrastructure could be obtained.

> This is just a fun side-project for me. If you would want to use this code, it would be nice to let me know.
